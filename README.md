## Utilizing HHL (Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd) to solve wave equations

Mentor(s): Segun Oguntunnbi

Description: The equation d^2rp/dt^2 -c^2 d^2rp/dr^2 =0 represents a wave equation that describes wave propagation in 2D space and time. In the context of noise transmission through air, this equation can represent the behavior of pressure disturbances generated by a point source in quiescent air or moving air.
